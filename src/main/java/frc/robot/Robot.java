/**
 * Description:
 * The SixTalonArcadeDrive example demonstrates the ability to create WPI Talons/Victors
 * to be used with WPI's drivetrain classes. WPI Talons/Victors contain all the functionality
 * of normally created Talons/Victors (Phoenix) with the remaining SpeedController functions
 * to be supported by WPI's classes. 
 * 
 * The example uses two master motor controllers passed into WPI's DifferentialDrive Class 
 * to control the remaining 4 Talons (Follower Mode) to provide a simple Tank Arcade Drive 
 * configuration.
 *
 * Controls:
 * Left Joystick Y-Axis: Drive robot in forward and reverse direction
 * Right Joystick X-Axis: Turn robot in right and left direction
